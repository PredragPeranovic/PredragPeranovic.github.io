I'm a software developer who currently works as solo entrepreneur at [Blokkod](https://blokkod.me) trying to develop [Jembe](https://jembe.io) web framework for us ordinary developers so that we can quickly and easily build modern web apps for small businesses.

### Why this blog?

I want to learn how to better express myself in writing, so that people, at least, can understand what I'm trying to say.
