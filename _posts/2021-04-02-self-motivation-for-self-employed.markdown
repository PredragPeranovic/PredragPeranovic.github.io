When someone thinks about a self employed person, freelancer or solo entrepreneur, call it whatever you like, they usually imagine  a sunny beach, a cocktail and casually working on the laptop between sunbathing, swimming and surfing. 
If it is not the beach, most people will certainly say something like “You can do whatever you want, you don’t have a boss and you can choose to do whatever is interesting to you”.

Maybe I'm doing something wrong but to me, as a self employed, the picture of laying on the beach and working is equivalent to a nightmare. That picture probably means that my job is an utterly mess that needs constant attention so I can’t have one day off without a laptop. Can’t tell me that someone actually likes to bring the laptop on vacations and work on it?

The thing that you have no boss, to me, can mean either of two things:

- You have the worst boss on the planet, someone who knows all your little secrets: Yourself;
- Or every client is your boss, yikes :/.

So how I imagine a solo entrepreneur or an entrepreneur in general: 

- Someone who tries to make a living by doing things that he or she likes or cares the most.
- Someone who may or may not try to change the world but who is willing to fight his own battles  and face all challenges head on without compromise. 
- And most importantly someone, who is willing to fight with himself and ready to constantly change, improve and evolve.

Because harsh truth, for self employed, is that, yes you can choose the interesting thing that you will be working on but you also need to finish  all the other non so interesting things in order to move forward. Keep in mind that you are far from an expert in doing “the other things'' and there is a loot to learn. In the end, If I can squeeze half of your time doing things that I like or care about, I fell lucky and well organised. 

If you are now ready to throw some wisdom to me like “Hire someone to do the boring stuff”, let's just leave it for another short essay to discuss all its pros and cons.

Lets finish with, self-motivation “mantra” that I recently heard and resonated with me:
__“If you don't do the boring stuff, you are stuck where you are and nothing will change and you can't move forward”__
