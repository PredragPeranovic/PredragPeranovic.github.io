I'm a software developer working as a solo-entrepreneur at [BlokKod](https://blokkod.me) trying to develop [Jembe](https://jembe.io) web framework for quickly building modern internal business apps.

### Why this blog?

I want to learn to better express myself so that readers can understand me better.
