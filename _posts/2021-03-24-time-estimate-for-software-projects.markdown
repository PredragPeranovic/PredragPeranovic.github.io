Yesterday I built this blog using Jekyll and Github pages. I followed the tutorial *"Build a Blog In Five Minutes"*, but it took me more than *three hours to do it*.

Am I that slow, or am I doing something wrong?

In my defense, I spend most of the time:

- setting up the project on GitHub;
- setting up Google Analytics;
- configuring DNS records;
- installing Ruby on my laptop;
- placing a picture of me and polishing it with CSS;
- writing a message in the footer.

*Maybe, if I had everything prepared in advance, I would spend 5 minutes building the blog.*

This reminds me of my own mistake: 
- *Placing an action button on the page should not take me more than one minute, right?* 
- Wrong!!! I usually spend more than five minutes per button. 
- Why? Because I'm forgetting about the time needed to:
    - type the code;
    - find a good icon;
    - adjust margins and padding;
    - polish look with CSS;

Maybe there is a pattern here: 

- **when the job is dominantly creative or engaging, we tend to overlook uncreative and grinding work**;
- forcing us to underestimate the time needed to finish the project.

## The proper way to estimate the deadline

1. Give your initial estimate as you usually do;
2. Deliberately think about all the grinding work that needs to be done, and add time for it; 
3. Multiply everything with 2 or 3 and hope for the best;
4.  As you work, periodically review and adapt the project scope to hit the deadline.
