We have all been there, watching some piece of software, and thinking it is such a simple and obvious solution to the problem. It required no effort for “them” to make it, I could do it ten times faster and ten times better if I just tried. So naive and inexperienced to think that simple and elegant is easy to build. 

Finding elegant solutions is similar to finding the balance point of some three-dimensional object, but with a twist, you don't know its shape or material density. 

For example, when building new software, you are embarking on a journey of discovery. You need to find and understand all potential use cases for your software. You need to understand users' expectations and motivation to use your software. You need to know what tradeoffs are acceptable and be willing to make them. 

It may sound silly but It’s hard for me to define the actual value that the software brings to its users. Sometimes I need to go through multiple iterations to actually understand the value in the eyes of the users. You can imagine how hard it is to separate important requests/features from not-so-important and undesirable ones when you don’t know the actual value of your solution.

In retrospect, it looks very easy to create an “elegant solution” when you have a clear picture and full understanding of the problem with all its boundary cases. In other words, when you know the shape of the object it is easy to find its center of gravity. 

So the inevitable truth is that building the elegant solution takes many iterations. With every iteration, you discover and better define the shape of the project. Just keep in mind that every new discovery has a chance to render all previous iterations obsolete, simply because you took some wrong assumptions in the beginning and now you need to start coding from a scratch.
