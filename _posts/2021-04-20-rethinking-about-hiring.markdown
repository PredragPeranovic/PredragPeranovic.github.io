Let’s rethink hiring someone to help me as a solo-entrepreneur for work  that I'm not good at or takes me a lot of time.

Let's sum up reason for hiring someone:

1. It’s cheaper to hire someone to do things instead of you (their hourly rate is less than yours);2
2. New hire can “earn” his salary and you can find enough paid work for him;
3. You can’t/wan’t do the job but it needs to be done;

Ways to “hire” someone  are:

1. Part-time job / freelancer, payed by the job or hourly;
2. Full time employe;

First thing first, if I hire anyone full time there is a real chance that he or she will earn more money than I do. 

My income can be divided into “steady” and “irregular”. Steady income is acquired through a “support and maintenance contracts” while irregular is acquired by doing one time projects/applications/consultancy. My steady income can currently support minimum wage and regular business expenses and the majority of my actual income comes as a result of doing one time projects/applications/consultancy that can but doesn’t need to continue with a support contract. 

So the reason to hire full-time employees, because it’s cheaper than doing things by myself is out of question.

Hiring someone full time and finding paid work for him can actually work but that will transform  my “company” to an agency. Even if the majority of my income currently comes from me doing one time projects I’m still trying  to find another profitable business model. Hiring someone and “finding” work for him will instantly transform me to an agency and that is something that I don’t want to do.


To sum up hiring full time employee:

1. I’m not steadily earning enough money to pay someone full time to do things instead of me.

   On the other hand I could probably hire a personal assistant full time but it’ll probably save my couple days per month and the rest of the time he or she just will not have enough work to do.

   Can I create useful work for a personal assistant, not really.
  
2. I’m still dreaming of becoming a “product” centric company and don't want to become an agency like company. So hiring people and finding work for them currently is not the option.

   Just to be completely truthful, becoming an agency like company is not a bad business decision. It's probably the safest way to become really profitable and build a company. And if creating a product centric company does not work, this can be a viable option.

3. Hiring someone full time because i can’t do the job is not the option, because I can do everything :).

   Joking aside (I know that I can’t do everything but) I have enough freedom to choose work that I can do and stay away from work that I can’t do. With this thinking I’m probably hearting the growth of the company but … let me repeat myself I’m currently not building an agency like company and I’m too small and don’t have enough money nor “other” internal work to justify hiring someone full time.

With full time hiring out of question for “reasons” above, let’s consider hiring part time.

1. I’m not a fan of hiring someone part time to do the business administration work evolving money, invoicing and similar stuff. Maybe I'm a little paranoid but really like to keep “in house” anything that involves money and client relationships.

2. Other types of administrative work occurs sparingly and it’s not easy to hire someone to do it because it’s usually very specific work. I call it leg work because it involves walking from place to place, filling some forms, getting some documents etc. You may think anyone can do it, and you are right.

   I’ll need to ask around and find someone who can do it for an acceptable price, a couple times a year when this kind of work takes me from 3 to 5 working days. 

3. Hiring designer, web developer, marketer etc. part time can be viable options, I’m probably too afraid to do it because of hassle involved in communication and the quality of end result. 

   I should take the risk and face my fears of losing time and resources in pursuit for someone willing to do good work part time. (Any practical advice where to look for and how to approach part time workers is welcome).


In essence, I’m afraid  to hire someone because I can spend more time and resources on searching for hire, explaining and transferring knowledge than time needed for me to do the work.

I’m out of excuses for not hiring someone, it’s obvious that I should hire someone part time, freelancer or similar to help with: administrative leg work, web design and marketing.

Now I need to find ways to do it.

**P.S. If someone can help me to make a good hire, please contact me :)**
