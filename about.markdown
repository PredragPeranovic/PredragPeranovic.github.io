I'm a software developer and solo entrepreneur at [BlokKod](https://blokkod.me), building business applications for clients.

I'm also building:

- [Jembe](https://jembe.io) - web framework to make my work quicker and easier;
- [TaskClip](https://taskclip.me) - task manager for architects to help my brother and to learn how to develop Saas products.

### Why this blog?

I want to learn to better express myself and help others in the process.
