First, allow me to explain myself. I’m writing a software framework for developing internal business applications, and I need to write documentation, tutorials, guides, and marketing materials to give the project a chance to become successful.

You may ask, how bad am I at writing? Let me put you in perspective. My highest grade in writing exams during high school was C for writing in my natural language. Now I'm trying to write in a foreign language (English) where my knowledge is far from fluent. You are warned! 

Rules for the challenge: 

- Every day write an article about anything and;
- Publish it online.

The goals of the challenge are: 

- Become a better writer;
- Develop a habit of writing.
- Pass my internal barriers to put myself in front of the public.

I don’t expect to become a good writer but I’m hoping to be able to write readable documentation, tutorials, and marketing. I don’t want my writing to look like computer code or mathematical theorems. 

With hopes that next time I need to explain my work, it will not take me ten times more to write an explanation than to do the work.

_Time to write (40min)_
