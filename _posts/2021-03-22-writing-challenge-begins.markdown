First, allow me to explain myself. I’m writing a software framework for developing internal business applications, and I need to write documentation, tutorials, guides, and marketing materials to give the project a chance to become successful.

You may ask, how bad am I at writing? Let me put you in perspective. My highest grade in writing exams during high school was C for writing in my natural language. Now I'm trying to write in a foreign language (English) where my knowledge is far from fluent. You've been warned! 

Firstly, here are the rules for the challenge: 

- Every day for the next 100 days I need to write a small article about anything that I want and put that article online.

Secondly, the goals of the challenge are: 

- By writing lots of articles, I'm hoping to become a better writer and develop a habit of writing.
- Publishing articles will force me to confront and pass my internal barriers to put myself in front of the public while remaining honest and direct in my words.

I don’t expect to become a good writer but I’m hoping to be able to write readable documentation, tutorials, and marketing stuff. I don’t want my writing to look like computer code or mathematical theorems. 

With hopes that next time when I need to explain my work, it will not take me ten times more to write an explanation than to do the work.

_Time to write (40min)_
