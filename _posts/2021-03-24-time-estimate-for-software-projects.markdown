Yesterday I built and published this blog site using github pages. It took me more than three full hours to finish it. Three hours may not seem a lot but every article that describes the process was literally saying “build a blog in five minutes”. Am I that slow or we developers are that bad at estimating how much time we need to finish a project? Even if article titles are written as “marketing hooks” time would be seriously underestimated even if it says in a half hour instead of five minutes.

I  confess, I’m not a Ruby developer and I used Jekyll so ended up installing ruby and all necessary gems on my Ubuntu machine, which took some time to download and compile. 

But maybe we as developers who love to learn and create, are only taking in account time needed to do  “fun stuff” but completely underestimate time needed to do “not so fun staff”.

For example when I need to put a new button on a html page and style it, since I have done that numerous times, i think it will take me one minute per button and five minutes for ten buttons. In reality I’ll probably spend at least 15 minutes to add just one button,  because I’m forgetting all the small and repetitive things that need to be done in order for that button to call an action, like: adjusting html around the button, polishing its look with css classes, deciding on button title and icon, deciding does the action needs confirmation, deciding on colors, borders ...


What is also interesting is that when I need to give a time estimate for how long it will take to hike some mountain, or to cut the grass in the yard or to do any type of manual labor, I’m usually spot on with my estimate. Similarly my time estimate is usually correct  for any type of administrative work even for system or database administration, excluding handling incidents. 

Maybe when the job is dominantly “creative”, yes I consider programming to be a creative job, we tend to underestimate time needed to finish it by more than three times over, just because we are overlooking all uncreative and grinding work.
