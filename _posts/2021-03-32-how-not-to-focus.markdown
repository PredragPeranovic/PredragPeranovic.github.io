Keeping focus on work at hand has become quite hard for me. Two particular things especially: 
- To begin with work at first place and later on 
- To switch to different types of work. 

When I eventually start working it's not a problem to stay in focus for a long period of time but switching to some other work becomes almost impossible, so I lose a lot of time when switching.

Keeping focus has become a problem for the first time around 10 years ago when I was working non stop for a couple years, day and night, without break, on multiple projects simultaneously. After some time I became easily distracted and the first "low focus" period in my life started. It took me more than half a year to get over it. Getting over it will not be posible without help from a really good friend who was able to listen to my rambling for one whole night.

Now after all these years I can say with confidence that the cure was temporary. The "low focus" period repeats periodically every two years or so and lasts for a couple weeks up to the whole month, especially when I’m not able to take a rest and must push with work.

If you wonder, I'm still working hard but I'm also trying to limit my work on 8 hours per day.

Solution is still the same, find someone to talk to and rest for a couple weeks.

If I could give my younger self advice, it would be to take a break and stop pushing when it is hard to contrecate on work. Take a week or two off  and go somewhere without a computer, without contact with work and recuperate. Otherwise if you push,  you will do irreversible damage to yourself and you’ll need strong mental will to go through periods of "low focus" for the rest of your life.
