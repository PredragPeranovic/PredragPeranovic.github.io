I am starting this writing challenge because I'm a really bad writer and good writing is one of the essential skills to make progress in personal and professional life. 

First, allow me to explain to you my current situation. I’m writing a software framework for developing business applications, and besides writing the actual software I need to write documentations, tutorials,  guides and marketing materials in order to give the project a small chance to  become successful.

You may ask, how bad am I at writing? Let me put you in perspective. My highest grade in writing during highschool was C and that is for writing in my natural language but now I'm trying to write in english to reach a larger audience :). Is my english good? Let just say that my grade in english during highschool was marching between D and E. Now you know what to expect from this challenge. 

Firstly, here are the rules for the challenge: 

- Every day for the next 100 days I need to write a small article about anything that I want, and put that article online.

Secondly, goals of the challenge are: 

- By writing lots of articles, I'm hoping to become a better writer and develop a habit of writing.
- Publishing articles online will force me to confront and hopefully pass my internal barriers to put myself in front of the public while still remaining honest and direct in my words.

I don’t expect to become a really good writer but I’m hoping to become good enough to write readable documentation, tutorials and some marketing stuff. I really don’t want for my writing to look like computer code or mathematical theorems. 

With hopes that next time when I need to write something, like email or technical analysis, it will not take me ten times more time to write staff down than to actually do the work.
