Yesterday I built this blog using Jekyll and Github pages. Even if all tutorials are saying **"build a blog in five minutes"**, it took me more than **three hours to do it**. 

Am I really that slow and terrible, or developers are seriously underestimating the time needed to do "the work"?

Perhaps, we, developers, love to learn and create, so we are taking into account only the time needed to do “fun stuff” and completely forgot about the time needed to do “boring stuff”.

Take putting a button on the page as an example.
-  My first estimate is one minute per button.
- Reality is closer to fifteen or more minutes per button because I'm forgetting about:
    - the time needed to type the "code";
    - adjusting margins and padding and surrounding content;
    - deciding on the title and icon;
    - polishing look with CSS;
    - deciding on a shade of colors, borders, shadows, etc.

On the other hand, I'm spot on when estimating the time to do manual labor like:
- hiking a mountain;
- cutting grass in a yard;
- fixing house appliances, etc,

Maybe when the job is dominantly “creative”, **we tend to underestimate the time** by more than three times, just **because we are overlooking all uncreative and grinding work**.

_Time to write (45min)_
