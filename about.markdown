I'm a software developer who currently works as solo entrepreneur at [Blokkod](https://blokkod.me) trying to develop [Jembe](https://jembe.io) web framework for us ordinary developers so that we can quickly and easily build modern web apps for small businesses.

## Why this site exist

For me to learn how to express myself better in writing, so that people can at least understand what I'm trying to say.
