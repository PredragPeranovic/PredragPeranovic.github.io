I'm a software developer who currently works as a solo-entrepreneur at [Blokkod](https://blokkod.me) trying to develop [Jembe](https://jembe.io) web framework for us, ordinary developers, to quickly build modern web apps for small businesses.

### Why this blog?

I want to learn how to better express myself in writing so that people can understand me better.
